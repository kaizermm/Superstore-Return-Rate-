## Aim of this project
Based on the dataset, various factors such as category, ship mode, month, states, and customers can influence the return rate in the Superstore dataset. The purpose of this dashboard is to analyze the Superstore.xls dataset and provide valuable insights into the return rate. As assigned by the CEO, my task is to identify the top five most significant factors that can impact returns. These include determining the month with the highest return rate, identifying the category and ship mode that contribute the most to returns, identifying the customer with the highest return rate, and pinpointing the state with the highest return rate. By answering these questions, we aim to better understand the key factors influencing returns and provide actionable solutions for the Superstore to reduce return rates and enhance overall performance.
 ## Target audience
 The target audience for this project includes:
1. CEO: The objective is to identify the key factors contributing to a high return rate and develop effective policies to mitigate the issue.
2.	Store manager: The purpose of this initiative is to empower store managers with valuable insights derived from the CEO's policies.
3.	Store supervisor: The objective is to utilize the insights gained from the analysis to ensure that the workers align their practices with the CEO's guidelines.

The project's primary goal is to equip the CEO with actionable insights, allowing them to comprehend the crucial factors driving customer returns and formulate effective strategies to mitigate and reduce the volume of returned orders. To achieve this, the Dashboard will facilitate an extensive analysis of multiple variables, including product categories, shipping methods, customer profiles, and order attributes. This analysis will uncover patterns and identify the underlying causes of the high return rate. By providing the CEO with this vital information, they will be able to implement targeted measures and enhance overall operational efficiency.
